# Day 6 - Deployment Preparation and Staging

## Objective
Today, I focused on preparing my marketplace for the live environment by setting up a staging environment and configuring hosting platforms. This is to ensure everything runs smoothly and is ready for customers. I also worked on managing different environments (development, testing, and production) to ensure reliability.

---

## Step 1: Hosting Platform Setup

### 1. Choose a Platform
- **Platform:** Vercel (for deployment) & GitHub (for version control)
- **Reasoning:** Vercel is fast, user-friendly, and ideal for quick deployments. GitHub helps with code management and collaboration. Future configurations may explore AWS or Azure if needed.

### 2. Connect Repository
- Connected GitHub repo to Vercel for automatic deployment.
- Configured build settings and scripts for smooth deployment.

---

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

### 1. Create a `.env` File
- Added sensitive variables such as API keys and tokens.

### 2. Upload Variables to Hosting Platform
- Used Vercelâ€™s dashboard to securely add environment variables.

---

## Step 3: Deploy to Staging

### 1. Deploy Application
- Logged into Vercel and selected the GitHub repository.
- Initiated the build process to deploy the app to a staging environment.

### 2. Validate Deployment
- Checked Vercel deployment logs for errors.
- Verified staging environment by testing:
  - Page loads correctly
  - Key features (user login, product listings, search) work
  - No broken links or missing assets.

---

## Step 4: Staging Environment Testing

### 1. Testing
- Functional Testing: Ensured core features work as expected.
- Security Testing: Verified app security measures are in place.
- API Testing: Checked API endpoints for correct responses.

### 2. Performance Testing
- Assessed application performance under different conditions.

### 3. Test Case Reporting
- Documented all test cases and results.
